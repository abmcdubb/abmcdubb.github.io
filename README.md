Welcome to the code for my personal website. Nothing to see here...

*** TODO: ***
- [ ] Consider: Do I like what happens on link hover?
- [ ] Clean up scrolling "navbar", link it to scroll to the top, or do something useful
- [ ] Build mobile friendly version
- [ ] Redesign projects panel to take up full screen, remove carousel. Inspiration (http://www.jennyjohannesson.com/). Maybe discuss with Jane.
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Complete / figure out blog page
- [ ] Add opacity to main image to allow text to be more visible
- [ ] Force pictures to load before text 
- [ ] Consider blur to focus to replace main image rendering so the page doesn't have to wait to load higher quality final image (https://css-tricks.com/the-blur-up-technique-for-loading-background-images/)
- [ ] Add effect on hover to main buttons
- [ ] Fix color of projects text
- [ ] Replace loading SVG with homegrown css animation
- [ ] Replace alishamcwilliams.com image with gif
